Description
-----------

In the Semsort block courses are grouped by their starting dates in a semester view on the MyMoodle
page.

The Semsort block also displays all MyMoodle information regarding the course activities of the
individual courses.

The module will also feature a "My favourites" area, for which courses from different semesters can
be selected and they will then be listed at the top of the favourites area.


Example
-------

Use the Semsort module to display the winter and summer semesters with all your courses,
and the favourites area for quick access.

------------

The plugin is available for Moodle 2.5+. This version is for Moodle 3.3.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-blocks_semsort/issues).
Please provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if
applicable, a screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
